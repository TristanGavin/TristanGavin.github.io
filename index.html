            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my website! I computer science major / math minor at Oregon State University. I am also a leader and teammate of OSU’s men’s division one rowing team where I spend most of my time going back and forth on a rowing machine until I am really sweaty and in a lot of pain. I also enjoy skiing, rock-climbing, rafting backpacking, and getting rad in the outdoors with my friends.

            <h3>Ski Bummin' in Tahoe</h3>
            <p>
                I didn't know what I wanted to do after high school, so I moved to Lake Tahoe to be a ski bum for a year. This was probably the most transformative year of my life. I didn't own a car so I would hitchhike to my job as a janitor at the Alpine Meadows ski resort. My shifts usually didn't end until midnight. Trying to a ride 20 miles back home in the middle of the night when it was below freezing outside had its downsides. I ended up buying a Ford Exploder with a broken transmission for $500. This was a great purchase besides the fact that it couldn’t go in reverse. This caused for some precarious situations to say the least. Living on an extremely low budget to chase the thrills of the outdoors forced me to be resourceful and independent.

                My roommate Leslie taught me how to fully appreciate the beauty and joy that nature provides. She took me on wild adventures and introduced me to all her friends when I was feeling lonely. I cannot be more grateful for my experience living there and for the people I grew so close with.
            </p>
    
            <h3 id="padtop">What Now?</h3>
            <p>
                I have temporarily set aside my passion for getting rad to focus on my personal and educational development. I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science with a focus in artificial intelligence. I am specifically interested in machine learning and the linear algebra and statistics behind it. Machine learning is an extremely powerful tool being used to solve complex and deep problems that were previously unapproachable. Deep Mind’s <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">AlphaFold</a> is an inspiring case of an incredible leap in science that could not have been achieved without machine learning algorithms. I hope to one day apply my knowledge to problems that would improve people’s lives.
